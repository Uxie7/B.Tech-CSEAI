# OBJECTIVE OF THE PROGRAM 
To implement a recursive solution for the Towers of Hanoi problem, illustrating the principles of recursion in problem-solving. 

---

# DESCRIPTION 
The Towers of Hanoi is a classic problem where three pegs and a number of disks are involved. The goal is to move all the disks from the source peg to the destination peg following these rules: 
     Only one disk can be moved at a time. 
     A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk. 
     All disks must end up on the destination peg in the same order.

# ALGORITHM  
1. Move n-1 disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg. 
2. Move the nth disk directly to the destination peg. 
3. Move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.
