# OBJECTIVE OF THE PROGRAM 
To implement a solution to the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a simple greedy algorithm and understand the challenges of combinatorial optimization.

# DESCRIPTION 
The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city. It is NP-hard, meaning there is no efficient solution for large instances, but heuristic or approximation algorithms can provide good solutions.

# ALGORITHM  
1. Start at any city as the current city. 
2. Find the nearest unvisited city and move to it. 
3. Repeat until all cities are visited. 
4. Return to the starting city to complete the tour.
